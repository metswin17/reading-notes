Command to type in, later you will cover this but must input as follows to begin

Public static void main ( String [ ] argos) { }

To run program hit > on top right or hit shift f10

If we have written the main method successfully it should say

“Process finished with exit code 0”
Means everything is running fine

To help output some text in the console window 
Type - System . out . print (“I like pizza“);
> or shift F10  you should see I like pizza 

Use println for separate lines , 
Or use a \n at the end of the quote line \n” for separate lines (next line)
> or shift F10

To write a comment use // or multi line comment /*this is a multi line comment*/
Comments will not be seen. You can use file settings color scheme and console font to change size of font and change color to highlight areas or fade areas out like comments
