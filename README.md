**open mind**

 > What you confess, you Possess

 emphasizes what comes from our mouth, is the very thing we believe. If doubt it's true, 
if positive affirmation it's true. Words have a *strong affect* on our <ins>attitude</ins>. 
Determination is a powerfull force to help aide with knowledge and natural ability. 

**3 areas of uplifting self talk**

__Effort__ helps in all aspects of work. The Ant that knocks down the rubber tree plant. 
Always keep going and stop to refuel mentally as well as physically.

__Access the day__ take in what you've done and see what you can do better. 
But always commend yourself for what you achieved. You are your own cheerleader

__Obstacles__ Always see the road ahead. Obstacles were meant to be climbed over
work around, dig under or knock out of your way. It does not stop you. It only
gets your past experience or new outlook to get in gear and push through
***Yes you can***


__Intro__ 

I have been in many fields and have enjoyed some quite more than others. I have always been 
fascinated by coding and really believe this will culminate my career to stay enthusiastic 
about my work. I have always been more fascinated by people and learning about different cultures 
and lifestyles. Having a good work space and good coworkers is a plus that helps your day   
and your attitude. I hope we all have a wonderful Christmas with our families and friends and 
a fantastic 2027 New Years.
