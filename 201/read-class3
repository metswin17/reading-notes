HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the meaning and structure of web content.Generally a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript). HTML is the Skeleton building block of the web

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another

HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <search>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.


An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by < and >. The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive

The anatomy of an HTML element — element, opening tag, content, closing tag, attributes.
Understanding that HTML needs to be correctly nested.
An HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.

At its most basic, the web uses a client/server architecture 
 client (usually a web browser) sends a request to a server
using the http protocol. The server answers the request using the same protocol.

HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the 
1 Get method 
Ex "Hey server, I want to get this resource."
2 Post method
Ex "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result."

Web Forms allow users to enter data, which is generally sent to a web server for processing and storage, or used on the client-side to immediately update the interface in some way 
Forms are one of the most basic primary interactions users will have with your websites (and mobile apps) (Smashing Magazine)

The head of an HTML document is the part that is not displayed in the web browser when the page is loaded.

It may not surprise you that HTML has a convenient set of elements that allows us to define different types of list. On the web, we have three types of lists: unordered, ordered, and description lists. 
In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column")


Hyperlinks when clicked or otherwise activated, cause the browser to navigate to other documents or resources, sometimes specific parts of documents. Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to offer

Link targets are URLs. A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, is a string of text that defines where something is located on the Web







These areas we are covering , is breaking down reasons to use certain elements to achieve the best results and not repeat excess amount duplicate code writing



When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?
When the sequence is not important.  
How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?
list-style-type: square;
When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?
When the process steps matter use ordered list. Such as instructions in a recipe otherwise use unordered if the steps or list does not matter 
Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?
You can change the start value with <ol start="5">
Or roman numerals with <ol type="I">

The Box Model
Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?
In the Box Model Margin is the space between spaces , it’s all of the box around all of the content
Padding helps margin by creating the viewable content that stays within it’s created space without coming out and staying neatly within the edges

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.
1 Content = the space where text images etc .. are 
2 Padding - the space between all the contents 
3 Border - the outside edge of the content
4 Margin The space between all contents  
Learn JS
Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops.
What data types can you store inside of an Array?
Numbers , strings , booleans , objects
Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?
Yes it is and you access it by index sequence order 
const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
3 List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.
Addition , Subtraction, Division, Multiplication , Modulas
4 Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.
let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
In JavaScript, when you use + with a number and a boolean, the boolean gets converted to a number.
false becomes 0


true would become 1
“10dog”
5 Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.
Checking if a runner achieved a speed needed to qualify for a tournament 

6 Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.
Running a numbers guessing game
