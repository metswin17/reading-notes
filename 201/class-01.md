3 In what way do clients and servers interact with each other
The client requests and the server responds with information or images 
The client and server we've described above don't tell the whole story. There are many other parts involved, and we'll describe them below.
Your internet connection: Allows you to send and receive data on the internet. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.
TCP/IP: Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. Like your car or bike
DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is like an address book for websites
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods. See HTTP basics below.
Files: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
Code: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — the different programming languages websites are written in, which the browser interprets and assembles into a web page to display to a user.
Assets: This is a collective term for all the other items that appear on a website — such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs — that aren't code that the browser interprets.
