Control Flow 

Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
 Ex.  if , else 

Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

What are Functions?
Functions are fundamental building blocks in all programming.
Functions are reusable block of code designed to perform a particular task.
Functions are executed when they are "called" or "invoked".
Functions enable better code organization and efficiency.

Accessing a function without (), returns the function itself and not the result:

In JavaScript, function parameters and arguments are distinct concepts:
Parameters are the names listed in the function definition.
Arguments are the values received by the function.

Functions can be used as variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

Operators are for Mathematical and Logical Computations
The Assignment Operator = assigns values
The Addition Operator + adds values
The Multiplication Operator * multiplies values
The Comparison Operator > compares values


There are different types of JavaScript operators:
Arithmetic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparison Operators
Logical Operators
And more …


Operator
Description
&&
logical and
||
logical or
!
logical not

At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output


Defining functions
Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces, { /* … */ }.
EX-   
js
function square(number) {
  return number * number;
}

What is a JavaScript function?
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a task when called.
What does it mean to invoke - or call - a function?
Invoking a function means calling it so its code runs.


What are the parenthesis () for when you define a function?
It’s the value created - the argument or user input
